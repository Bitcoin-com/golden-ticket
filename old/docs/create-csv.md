# Create CSV

Often there is more than one stakeholder in a project. For example at bitcoin.com when we create Golden Tickets for an event our Marketing team funds the event and keeps track of the metrics around which how many tickets were claimed. `create-csv` allow you to create a .csv with the `cashAddress`, `wif`, `claimed` and `value` for each Golden Ticket. This can be shared with your team so that everyone knows the addresses and private keys of all Golden Tickets. Also this .csv is used later w/ the `generate-stats` command.

When you run `create-csv` you'll be prompted for `eventName`, `hdAccount` and `ticketCount`. These values should be the values which you used in `create-tickets`.

You'll want to edit `create-csv.ts` to add in the different tiers that you'll be funding. For example in our previous step `create-tickets` we created 5 golden tickets. Now imagine that we want to fund 3 w/ $1, 1 w/ $5 and 1 w/ \$10. We would add the following to `create-csv.ts`. Make sure to run `npm run build` after you make changes to `create-csv.ts`.

```js
if (i <= 2) obj.value = 1
else if (i === 3) obj.value = 5
else if (i === 4) obj.value = 10
```

Now when you run `create-csv` you will get a .csv with the breakdown of tiers which you can share w/ your team.

```
npm run create-csv

prompt: eventName: exampleEvent
prompt: hdAccount: 0
prompt: ticketCount: 5
All done. âœ…
ðŸš€ exampleEvent.csv written successfully.
```

You can see what is in your .csv file.

```
cat exampleEvent.csv
